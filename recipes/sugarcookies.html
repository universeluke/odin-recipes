        <h3> Description</h3>
        <p>Sugar cookies are super simple to make, but are great with a cup of tea in the Winter.</p>
        <p>While the cookies themselves are easy to make, decorating them can be a whole other task, and you can be as simple or as elaborate as you like!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>100g unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>100g caster sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>30g cornflour</li>
            <li>300g plain flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat the butter and sugar with an electric whisk for 4 mins until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then add the vanilla. Whisk in the cornflour and plain flour until the mixture comes together into a dough. Put the dough between two pieces of baking parchment, and roll out to a 6mm thickness using a rolling pin. Chill for 30 mins.</li>
            <li>Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Peel the top layer of parchment off the dough and stamp out circles using a 6cm round cutter (or the shape of your choice). Re-roll any offcuts and continue stamping out rounds until all the dough is used. Transfer the cookies to a second large baking sheet lined with baking parchment, spacing them 2cm apart (you may need two sheets). Bake for 7-10 mins. Leave to cool on the sheet for 15 mins, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. <em>Will keep in an airtight container for one week.</em></li>
        </ol>
